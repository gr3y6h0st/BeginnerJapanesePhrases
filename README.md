# Japanese for Newbies: Basic Phrases, Vocabulary, and Hiragana

A personal project explores an interest in learning the Japanese Language, while also learning practicing Android Development!

The core function of the app is to provide reference and quick access to commonly used Japanese Vocab and Phrases displayed in their Romaji (Western 26 letter-alphabet) form. 

More eager and curious users can take their learning a step further by accessing the app's Hiragana Syllabary, which provides an audio sample of each Hirgana character's phonetic pronunciation and a respective GIF Image visual of their stroke order patterns.

Lastly, the app does provide a English -> Japanese translation feature based off Google's Cloud Translate API. In it's current form, the sole purpose is to provide a simple method of translation for any material not covered by the app or too complex for novice-level Japanese speakers.
